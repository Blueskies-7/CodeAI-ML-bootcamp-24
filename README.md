Sentiment Analysis on Customer Feedback Using NLP: This project leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) to assess customer reviews. By utilizing the VADER sentiment analyzer and TextBlob, it calculates sentiment scores and subjectivity. These scores are categorized into classes such as Highly Positive, Positive, Neutral, Negative, and Highly Negative. Developed with Streamlit, the application features a user-friendly interface that allows for real-time text input, sentiment analysis, and text cleaning. Additionally, it provides graphical representations of sentiment score distributions and displays samples of the processed data, offering a clear understanding of customer sentiments.

Analyzing WhatsApp Data Using Advanced Excel and Power BI: This project involved analyzing WhatsApp data with advanced Excel and Power BI. The process included importing and cleaning large datasets, followed by in-depth data analysis to uncover patterns and insights. Interactive dashboards and visualizations were created using Power BI to effectively communicate the findings. The project showcased the ability to manage real-world data, employ advanced analytical tools, and derive meaningful conclusions from complex datasets.

Diabetes Prediction and Analysis: This project, "Diabetes Prediction and Analysis," investigates the relationships between various health indicators and diabetes status through data visualization, logistic regression, and statistical analysis. It focuses on visualizing correlations with factors like smoking and alcohol consumption, constructing a logistic regression model for diabetes prediction, and performing ANOVA to detect significant differences in health indicators between diabetic and non-diabetic individuals. The project aims to identify key predictors of diabetes, develop predictive models, and statistically validate these relationships, offering valuable insights for healthcare professionals and researchers.

Book Recommendation System: The Book Recommendation System project utilizes a collaborative filtering algorithm to provide personalized book recommendations. It involves loading and preprocessing book data, training a matrix factorization model like SVD to learn user and item latent factors, and using the trained model to predict ratings and suggest top books for users. This project illustrates the application of machine learning in creating an effective book recommendation system that adapts to user preferences and history.
